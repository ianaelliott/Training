## R training for psychologists  

### This is practice code and pseudo-randomised dummy data for basic R training purposes. 

The aim of this repository is to help existing psychologists that are trained in SPSS to learn how to replicate those basic skills, but on R Studio.  

The objective is to provide "two-minute tasks" (TMTs) that slowly take you through a basic analysis of typical psychological intervention data. 
Got two munutes? Do one task. Got ten minutes? Do a couple! The whole thing is intended to fill a 2-hour introduction session.

> Just remember, the beauty of R is that you can tailor your analyses in a million different ways - don't take these tasks as gospel!

### TMT 1: Download and install the software  
R: https://cran.ma.imperial.ac.uk/  
R Studio: https://rstudio.com  

### TMT 2: Understand a couple of basic need-to-knows  
- Anything after a hash will not run, so you can use those to annotate your code.  
- R is **CASE-SENSITIVE** so if you run into an error, check your spelling and/or capitalisations.  
- To **run** code, either:  
  - place the cursor into a single chunk of code you want to run and hit Ctrl+Rtn  
  - select (highlight) chunks of code that you want to run and click the "Run" button  
  - place the cursor at the start and hit "Run": it'll run everything!  
- If at first you don't succeed, **COPY AND PASTE IT INTO A SEARCH ENGINE!** :)  

> Seriously, whatever you've done I **guarantee** you, someone else has also done it and there's an explanation of how to fix it!
