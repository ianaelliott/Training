## R training for psychologists  

### This is practice code and pseudo-randomised dummy data for basic R training purposes.

The objective is to provide "two-minute tasks" (TMTs) that slowly take you through a basic analysis of typical psychological intervention data. 
Got two munutes? Do one task. Got ten minutes? Do a couple! 

Just remember, the beauty of R is that you can tailor your analyses in a million different ways - don't take these tasks as gospel!

Each task will link to a code file, that I recommend that you copy and paste into your 

### TMT 1: Download and install the software
